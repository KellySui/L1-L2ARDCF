## Videos of L1-L2ARDCF_HC tracking results on the datasets
### Results on Qingxian
https://github.com/KellySui/L1-L2ARDCF/assets/106424240/84ea66f1-4064-4e33-994f-ea1d8f818c19

The challenges included in this video are: occlusion, random ray interference and ambiguous targets. L1-L2ARDCF is consistently more accurate in localising AUV.
### Results on Yellow Sea

The main challenge contained in this video is: background clutter, where the background noise in the sequence is highly influential, resulting in the AUV features not being visible.
### Results on Enshi1
https://github.com/KellySui/videos4sonar/assets/106424240/23957510-3485-4b5b-8e46-abaaada0d011

The challenges included in this video are: scale variation, fake target and tugboat wake. The main reasons for the scale variation is the different angles of the AUV's motion to the sonar, which affects its appearance, fake targets, which is also a common challenge in underwater environments, and tugboat wake, which are a special challenge unique to the characteristics of our experimental conditions.
### Results on Enshi2
